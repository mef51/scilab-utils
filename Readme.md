Scilab-utils
============

[Scilab](http://www.scilab.org/) is an open-source math package similar to Matlab.
I use it to make plots for my physics labs.

I'll add any little scripts I write that help with my workflow.

*Update:*
[The IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) is an alternative to using Scilab. The workflow is simpler,
you learn python while using it, and the community is more alive. I still think making plots should be easier than this.

## quickPlot.sce
Takes data in the form of a CSV and plots it.
